# Contributing Workflow

## Golden rule
Work via PRs. No direct pushes to `main`.

## Required before PR
1. Read `docs/product/brief.md` and stay within scope.
2. Create a feature branch:
   - `feat/<short-name>` or `chore/<short-name>`
3. Keep PRs small and reviewable.

## Required checks
- Lint must pass
- Build must pass
- Playwright E2E must pass (CI)

## PR format
Use the PR template and include acceptance criteria.
